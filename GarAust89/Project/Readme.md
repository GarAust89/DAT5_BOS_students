## Gareth Austen Project for General Assembly Data Science Spring 2015

### Project Statment and Hypothesis

For my project I choese the Kaggle competition: *Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.* The purpose 
of this project is to try and predict what passengers survived and what passengers perished on the titanic.


### Data Description

Kaggle provide two datasets, a training and a test set, that contain identical variables. The training set 
has approximately twice as many observations as the test. A complete list of the variables provided by Kaggle 
is listed below:
