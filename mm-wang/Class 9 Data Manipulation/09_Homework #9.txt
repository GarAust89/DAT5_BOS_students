Homework #9


New Data Process
Retransform new data the same way you transformed
Remove any nonsignificant features
Predict on that data

1. split categorical data from numeric
	on categorical:
		replace strings not appearing in finalized training data with 'Other'
		binarize/encode
	on numeric:
		impute
2. merge the two
3. reduce columns used to RFECV determined as "final" column set
4. scale data
5. pass to estimator

Best Maximum Depth = 2
No need to do a grid search for maximum depth

Mean Grid Score on training data is 71.9%

Accuracy is about 81.9%
ROC is about 63.3%
Much worse prediction than the other methods previously chosen. The addition of categorical features such as the dominant team per player seem to have affected the accuracy by a significant amount.
